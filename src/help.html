<p>This is a tool for converting gcode files generated by slic3r (the
open source object slicing tool) for use by XYZ Printings XYZware
tool. The gcode file must come from a properly configured version of
slic3r. Should the gcode file not have the proper markers in it,
you'll get back an error message about it.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>Click <i>Choose File</i> to select the gcode file to convert. Then
click <i>Convert</i> to upload and convert the file. The results will
be downloaded with the extension <code>.3w</code> either replacing the
<code>.gcode</code> extension or appended to the file name, so the
converted <code>myslic3r.gcode</code> will be downloaded as
<code>myslic3r.3w</code>.</p>

<h2>Slic3r configuration</h2>

<p>XYZware reads the comments in a gcode file, looking for specific
information. If it fails to find that, it won't load the file or
printing may fail. So we configure slic3r to provide that information.</p>

<p>Since this information is in the comments, we use the slic3r
<i>Start G-code</i> setting. In my version of slic3r, this is in the
logical place: <i>Printer Settings</i> under <i>Custom G-code</i>.</p>

<p>Add the following to the <b>start</b> of that section:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    ; --- MOVE THIS SECTION TO THE TOP AND DELETE THIS LINE ---
    ; filename = composition.3w
    ; machine = daVinciF10
    ; material = abs
    ; layer_height = [layer_height]
    ; total_layers = 173
    ; total_filament = 0.00
    ; extruder = 1
    ; --- END SECTION ---
  </code>
</pre>

<p>The XYZify program finds the initial comment (<code>--- MOVE THIS
...</code>), removing any comments and blank lines it finds along the
way. The comments - and any actual g-code - between that line and the
last one (<code>--- END SECTION...</code>) are output, the lines
preceeding this section that haven't been removed are output, then the
rest of the file is output unchanged.</p>
